# Comparison of Support Vector Machine and Linear Regression (Classical Machine Learning Algorithms) 


Train two classifier methods and compare the results.
Had taken Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression (LR).


Dataset: Kaggle - Traffic, Driving Style and Road Surface Condition.


## Results of models:

Accuracy SVM/LR = 0.78/0.77
Balanced Accuracy SVM/LR = 0.73/0.71
F1-Score Breakdown SVM/LR = 0.86/0.85
