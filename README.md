# Traffic-Driving-Style-and-Road-Surface-ML

Train two classifier methods and compare the results.
Had taken Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression (LR).

Dataset: Kaggle - Traffic, Driving Style and Road Surface Condition.

## Results:

Accuracy SVM/LR = 0.78/0.77
Balanced Accuracy SVM/LR = 0.73/0.71
F1-Score Breakdown SVM/LR = 0.86/0.85
